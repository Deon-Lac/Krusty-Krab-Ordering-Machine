# Krusty-Krab-Ordering-Machine

- Hashmap traversal with a hint of Spongebob!
- Created a custom hashmap class in order to insert, traverse, hold menu items
- Outputs the menu, and hashmp updates based on user input
- Program ends when either the user is done ordering, or everything in menu is ordered!
